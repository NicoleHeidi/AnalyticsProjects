# Project Description

### This was a graduate project for my Intermediate Statistical Modeling for Business course. It centered around exploring a large dataset from a government database and applying various statistical models to evaluate relationships between variables.

### This project explored data on 675 parole violations in 2004 and analyzed cause-and-effect relationships and interactions between predictors. Exploratory data analysis was ran to compare demographic variables’ and conviction details’ effect on parole violations. 4 statistical models (logistic regression, ridge, LASSO, decision tree) were applied to create a model that best predicts violations.

### It was determined that age, multiple offenses, race, and state composes the best variable combination most predictive of a violation, with multiple offenses being most predictive on its own. The Classification Tree was the best overall model; it alongside the Logistic Regression and Ridge/LASSO models were useful for creating binary models, and PCA model was useful for grouping variables.
