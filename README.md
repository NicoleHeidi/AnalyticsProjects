# Graduate-Course-Projects
### Found in this repository are the business analytics graduate course projects that I have worked on. 

### These are projects that involved research, analysis,  modeling, and simulation across various platforms; SAP, R, Qualtrics, SPSS, Advanced Excel, and SQL. They required various analyses; qualitative analysis with exploratory data analysis, process modeling, and database modeling; quantitative analysis with statistical analysis and time series analysis; and experimental study design with survey analysis and A/B testing.
