# Project Description

### This was a graduate project for my Business Project Management course. It focused on closely learning about and modeling a business’s process to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness; to highlight ways to address specific business problems. 

### This project aimed to address slow retail days in LIT Boutique’s operations. It involved working with a LIT manager to create an AS-IS process of its retail sales process using SAP, running a process simulation for over 3 months, monitoring estimated resource consumption rates, and identifying bottlenecks. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed to discover missed conversion opportunities and process-related challenges.

### It was determined that although process activities are well spaced-out and steady profits are being earned, there are missed conversion opportunities and uneven resource utilization caused by the sales process. 3 actionable solutions were formulated that focus on task reallocation, local partnerships, and spare fitting rooms as merchandise displays.
