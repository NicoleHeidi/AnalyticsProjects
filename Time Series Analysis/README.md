# Project Description

### This was a graduate project for my Time Series Analysis course. It revolved around investigating a large dataset from a government database containing at least one decadeâ€™s worth of data; obtaining industry insights and comparing different models for analysis.

### This project investigated how emerging bookstore alternatives (e-books, digital comics) impacted U.S. book retailer sales over 2 decades. It analyzed fluctuating sales caused by rising literacy rates, COVID, and industry trends (e-reading and thrifting books). Seasonality analysis was conducted and 9 models including multiple decomposition, smoothing, and regression models were tested. 

### It was determined U.S. book retailer sales increased during the 90s and 2000s due to rising education and literacy rates, decreased in the 2010s with the popularity of e-book platforms, and increased in the 2020s post-pandemic with the trend of thrifting books. Sales fluctuate periodically due to school semester dates, and the linear regression model with SARIMA on residuals was the best model fit.
