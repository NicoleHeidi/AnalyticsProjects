# Project Description

### This was a graduate project for my Data Management and SQL for Analytics course. It revolved around building conceptual models and a relational database for a website to enhance usability. 

### This project examined a home booking website and performed database modeling to address business intelligence queries and  improve website performance. Conceptual models were constructed using entity relationship diagrams that comprises 10 unique entities. A relational database was developed using Oracle SQL Developer, and coding sequences were generated in SQL to determine correlations between cost, booking details, and reviews.

### The resultant product was a streamlined system that enabled reduced query response time and efficient retrieval of user data.
